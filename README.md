The Working of the Application is quite simple. Just Install the php script on on your web server and change the address of the webservices in android to your website's webservices and share the android application across all your participants and volunteer's to start the game.
Firstly Enter all the Clueset in the Add Clues Section in php Script. After all the Clue Set have been added if you want to copy those clues multiple times then go to your php script's folder and run multipleclue.php
Now Enter your participant's and volunteer's data from the php script
Then open the app and for partcipant's login they have to login via their Group-Id which had been allocated to them while registeration of their Team; for Volunteer's login they have to login via their registered E-mail ID.
# After Everything has been added (Participant's,Volunteer's and Clues Data) before the start of the game go to the allocate Clues Section and press the allocate clues button to allocate clues to all the teams. Note that there should be the same number of cluesset as the groups.
Now for Every Clue the Volunteer Will give a code to the participant. After etering the code the next Clue will be Unlocked.
